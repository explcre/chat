Now it supports chatgpt!
## How to deploy it with openai API key
I let chatgpt know my information and let it imitate me.

To use chatgpt function by yourself based on this repo,  change the API key in `./script.js`.
`var OPENAI_API_KEY = "";` lies in around line 23.

You can get the key from https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys

The format of api key is like `sk-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`


## How to change the predefined information learned by ChatGPT
If you want to change the predefined text of chatgpt please change in `./script.js`.

You can change the variable `var predefined_text="Can you imitate that you are Pengcheng Xu?...."` which lies in around line 10. 

Change the content of it and you will make chatgpt learn the thing you defined in advance!
